# Neural-Style-Transfer-
In this project we delve into the realm of Neural Style Transfer (NST) whichâ€™s a technique that uses deep learning to infuse an image with the artistic style of another. Typically NST has been computationally intensive which has restricted its capabilities. However this project seeks to overcome this challenge by harnessing the potential of MSG Net (Multi Style Generative Network) a learning framework specifically developed for real time NST. Using the capabilities of MSG Net we can unleash the power of Neural Style Transfer (NST) in real time. Just picture being able to upload a portrait and instantly witnessing it undergo a transformation, into a masterpiece inspired by Van Goghs style.. Imagine capturing a landscape and seeing it reimagined with the enchanting brushstrokes reminiscent of Monets Impressionist masterpieces. These examples just scratch the surface of the possibilities that this project unveils.
